# How to plan an application from the ground up

From requirements analysis to mockups, figuring out how and where to start

- [Requirements Analysis](#requirements-analysis)

- [Mockups](#mockups)


## Describe your Application in Words

- describe the **overall goal of the app**
- overview of **how it should work**
- write the **why**
- the goal of writing is to make you think about the application and work on your thoughts
- writing forces you to think more analytically about the subject and you'll end up with a great document for the future


## Stakeholders

- identify the **stakeholders**
  - who are involved?
  - who will benefit?
  - how?
  - what are their needs?
  - how will the app solve them?
- one of the most important stakeholders is the committer
- the committer is the one that takes the most important decisions, so itâ€™s the most important stakeholder
  - person that pays, in money or in time
- other stakeholders are the people who finance/sponsor the project
- users
- for every stakeholder you defined, research and document their goals
  - names, brief description
  - role in the project
  - why are they interested
  - how they are involved with the application
  - what are their goals


## Requirements Analysis

- for every stakeholder you defined, you had some goals
- define the requirements of the project that will help to satisfy those goals
- those requirements are the foundation upon which you'll build the application


## Application Architecture

- think about how, in general, an application should work
- create multiple architectures and decide which one is more appropriate
- must be interactive, have a database to store data
- blog site application example:
  - the main website page will list blog posts
  - clicking one post title will lead you to the blog
  - you will have an option to upvote and comment
  - have a login/sign up screen
  - after login you can submit your own blog and participate to the voting/comments


## Mockups

- creating a mockups is incredibly useful to make you think about what you want to create before writing a single line of code
- there are several tools that are great ways to imagine your application at a very high level
