## How to solve problems?

- use pseudo code and flow charts
- don't jump straight into code
- _think_ before typing any line of code


## Algorithms

- algorithms are the procedure used to solve any problem using pseudo code
- think out loud and write down all the things you must take care of
- starting with simple algorithms, you will train to be able to solve more difficult ones later on
- **create** a new algorithms **to solve new problems**
- creating algorithms is like writing code without worrying about syntax using different instruments, e.g., paper, stickies, arrows


## Flow charts

- flow charts are one visual tool to visualize any algorithm using a special set of illustrations
- start with beginning and end using oval shape
- arrow determines the direction of the flow
- identify each step with a rectangle
- decision step using diamond
- use circle to when two different roads meet again
- check other flow chart symbols, e.g., I/O, etc


## An example flow chart

Loop flow chart to "perform a task" for 10 times:

- define and initialize a `count` variable to `0` (rectangle)
- add conditional block, `is count = 10?` (diamond)
- if count is 10, go down and end the program
- if not, "perform a task" and increment the count, then check again
