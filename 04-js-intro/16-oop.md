## Introduction to Objects

- **object** is any value that's not of a primitive type
- objects are **always passed by reference**
  - arrays and functions are also objects under the hood
- objects can be defined in different ways
  - **object literal** syntax: `const car = { };`
  - `new Object()` and `Object.create()` syntax
- we can also initialize an object using the `new` keyword before a function constructor with a capital letter
  - then initialize the arguments we receive as parameters, to setup the initial state of the object

```js
function Car(brand, model) {
  this.brand = brand;
  this.model = model;
}

// initializing new object
const myCar = new Car('Ferrari', '812 GTS');
myCar.brand; //'Ferrari'
myCar.model; //'812 GTS'
```


## Object Properties

- objects have **properties**, which are composed by a property associated with a value
- properties value can be of any type, e.g., array, function or object
  - objects can have nested objects as properties
- properties can be any string, use quotes for invalid names that includes spaces, hypens or any special character
- multiple properties are separated by comma
- 2 different ways to access properties value: **dot notation** and **bracket notation** which is the only way to access invalid property names
  - accessing, adding or updating properties have the same notation
- accessing an unexisting property, will returned `undefined`

  ```js
  const car = {
    brand: {
      name: 'Ferrari'
    },
    'the brand': {
      name: 'Honda'
    },
    color: 'white'
  };

  // access: dot notation and bracket notation
  car.brand.name; // 'Ferrari'
  car['the brand']['name']; // 'Honda'

  car.doors; // undefined

  // adding/updating property
  car.model = '812 GTS';
  car.model; // 812 GTS
  ```


## Deleting properties from an object

- `delete` operator is used to delete a property/method from an object

  ```js
  // dot notation
  delete car.brand;

  // bracket notation
  delete car['brand'];
  ```


## Object Methods

- **methods** are functions assigned to an object property
- invoke with the parentheses at the end
- inside a method defined using a `function() {}` syntax we have access to the object instance by referencing `this`
  - we have access to the properties by using `this.properyName` syntax
- arrow functions doesn't have access to `this`
  - because **arrow functions are not bound to the object**
  - it's the reason why regular functions are often used as object methods

  ```js
  const car = {
    brand: 'Ferrari',
    model: '812 GTS',
    start: function() {
      console.log(`Started
        ${this.brand} ${this.model}`);
    },
    drive: destination => {
      console.log(`Drive going to ${destination}`);
    }
  };

  car.start();
  car.drive('Paris');
  ```


## The Prototype

- every JS object has a `prototype` property, which points to a different object called **object prototype**
- object prototype is used to inherit properties and methods
- `Object` is the prototype when creating an object
- `Array` is the prototype when initializing array
- `Object.getPrototypeOf()` and `Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf()` methods are used to check and verify prototype
- `Object.prototype` is the base prototype of all the objects
  - there is no prototype for `Object.prototype`, it's `null`
- **prototype chain** is prototype inside a prototype
  - object can extends Array and any object instantiated using it, will have Array and Object in its prototype chain and inherit properties and methods from all the ancestors

```js
const obj = {};
const arr = [];

Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) === Object.prototype; // true
Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(obj); // true

Object.getPrototypeOf(arr) === Array.prototype; // true
Array.prototype.isPrototypeOf(arr); // true

Object.getPrototypeOf(Array.prototype) === Object.prototype; // true
Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.prototype); // null
Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.prototype) === Object.prototype; // false
```


## Introduction to Classes

- classes defines a common pattern for multiple objects
- **Convention**: Use PascalCase for classes
- from this class, we can initialize an object with `new` keyword followed by class name
  - `student` is an _instance_ of the `Person` class
- classes can hold properties and methods
- setting and accessing properties/methods are the same with objects

  ```js
  class Person {
    greet() {
      return 'Hi, how are you?';
    }
  }

  const student = new Person();
  student.greet(); // 'Hi, how are you?'

  // setting/accessing property
  student.name = 'John';
  student.name; // 'John'
  ```


## Constructor Method

- `constructor()` is used to initialize the class properties when creating a new object instance
- we can instantiate a new object from the class, passing a string, and when we call greet, we;ll get a personalized message
  - when the object is initialized, the constructor method is called, with any parameters passed

  ```js
  class Person {
    constructor(name) {
      this.name = name;
    }

    greet() {
      return 'Hello, I am ' + this.name + '.';
    }
  }

  const student = new Person('John')
  student.greet() // 'Hello, I am John.'
  ```


## Static Methods

- normally methods are defined on the object instance, not on the class
- we can define a method as static to allow it to be executed on the class instead

  ```js
  class Person {
    static greet() {
      return 'Hello';
    }
  }

  Person.greet(); // Hello
  ```


## Inheritance in Classes

- `extends` keyword can **extend** a class with another class, and objects initialized using that class inherit all the methods of both classes
  - if we instantiate a new object with the child class, it has access to the parent class method
  - inside a child class, we can reference the parent class calling `super()`

  ```js
  class Person {
    greet() {
      return 'Hello, I am a Person';
    }
  }

  class Programmer extends Person {
    greet() {
      return super.greet() +
        '. I am also a programmer.';
    }
  }

  const student = new Programmer();
  student.greet(); // 'Hello, I am a Person. I am also a programmer.'
  ```


## Object Destructuring

- we can extract some values of an object and put them into named variables
- we can assign a property to a variable with another name

  ```js
  const person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    isProgrammer: true,
    age: 48,
  };

  const { firstName: name, age } = person;

  console.log(name); // 'John'
  console.log(age); // 48
  ```

- array destructuring and object destructuring have the same syntax
- creates 3 new variables by getting the items with index 0, 1, 4 from the array

    ```js
    const list = [1,2,3,4,5];
    const [first, second, , , fifth] = list;

    console.log(first); // 1
    console.log(second); // 2
    console.log(fifth) // 5
    ```

- main difference is that
  - array destructuring depends on the order that the value assigned to the variables
  - while object destructuring is based on the property names


## Cloning Objects

### Deep copy vs shallow copy

- shallow copy of an object successfully copies primitive types like numbers and strings,
  - but any object reference will not be recursively copied, but instead the new, copied object will reference the same object
  - if an object references other objects, when performing a **shallow copy** of the object, we copy the references to the external objects
- when performing a **deep copy**, those _external objects are copied as well_, so the new, cloned object is completely independent from the old one


### Using the Object spread operator

- spread operator provides a convenient way to perform a shallow clone, equivalent to what `Object.assign()` does

  ```js
  const copied = { â€¦original };
  ```

### Using Object.assign()

- `Object.assign()` performs a shallow copy of an object
- values are cloned, and objects references are copied (not the objects themselves)
  - so if we edit an object property in the original object, that's modified also in the copied object, since the referenced inner object is the same

  ```js
  const original = {
    name: 'Fiesta',
    car: {
      color: 'blue'
    }
  };

  const copied = Object.assign({}, original);

  original.name = 'Focus';
  original.car.color = 'yellow';

  copied.name; // Fiesta
  copied.car.color; // yellow
  ```

- libraries can help to deep clone in JS, e.g., Lodash with its `clonedeep` function


## Merging Objects

- spread operator is the perfect way to merge two objects into one object
  - **Note**: if both objects have a property with the same name, then the second object property overwrites the first

  ```js
  const object1 = {
    name: 'Flavio'
  };

  const object2 = {
    age: 35
  };

  const object3 = {...object1, ...object2 };
  ```
