## Difference with ESLint

- ESLint is a linter, not only formats the code, but also highlights some errors
  - can be used alongside Prettier
- things that can be customize:
  - tab width
  - use of single quotes vs double quotes
  - line columns number
  - use of trailing commas
- Prettier tries to keep the number of customizations under control, to avoid becoming too customizable

- can run from the command line using npm
- use Prettier directly from the editor, and the Prettier formatting will be run every time the code is save
- [Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for VS Code
